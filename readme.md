:rotating_light: **WARNING**: Running this will change the standard behaviour of Ubuntu *drastically*. :rotating_light:

Wait as setup runs - can take quite som time depending on your internet connection.

## FAQ

### What's installed?

Most importantly the [Regolith desktop](https://regolith-linux.org/)

Other than that... Well I'm probably not going to update this readme very often, so you'd better check out  [`setup`](https://github.com/krejac/dotlinux/blob/master/setup) for the nitty gritty details. 

### What do all those .bash-files do?

Nothing ireversible - if you backup your home catalog before running `setup` (they only change the Terminals behaviour). See  [The Lumber Room](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/) for a thorugh walkthrough.

### Why are you doing this?

To be able to quickly recover - and because if I do something more than a couple of times I prefer automation if possible. ;-)
