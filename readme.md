Wait as setup runs - can take quite som time depending on your internet connection.

## FAQ

### What's installed?

A bunch of different stuff. Apps mostly. Third party sources are added to apt though, so beware. ;)

### What do all those .bash-files do?

Nothing ireversible - if you backup your home catalog before running `setup` (they mainly change the behaviour and looks of your terminal). See  [The Lumber Room](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/) for a walkthrough.

### Why are you doing this?

To be able to quickly recover - and because if I do something more than a couple of times I prefer automation if possible. ;)
